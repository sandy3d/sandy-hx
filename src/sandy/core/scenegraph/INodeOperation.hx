/**
* Interface for node operations.
*
* <p>Implements the visitor design pattern:
* Using the visitor design pattern, you can define a new operation on Node
* and its subclasses without having to change the classes and without having
* to take care of traversing the node tree.</p>
*
* @example
* <listing version="3.1">
*     var mySpecialOperation:SpecialOperation = new SpecialOperation;
*
*     mySpecialOperation.someParameter = 0.8;
*     someTreeNode.perform(mySpecialOperation);
*     trace(mySpecialOperation.someResult);
*
*     mySpecialOperation.someParameter = 0.2;
*     someOtherTreeNode.perform(mySpecialOperation);
*     trace(mySpecialOperation.someResult);
* </listing>
